A brief look into the kind of things crafted or worked on in the past.

## Raft

During Covid in Amsterdam, the usual spring conversations about having a boat for summer were coming up in 2021. Together with a friend I decided to take a practical approach and just see what we can DIY.

Let me walk you through some parts of the process. After fiddling around with some sketches, we came up with a base construction in wood that would hold empty rain barrels - for floating - in place. Having a ground floor apartment with a little green space in the back came in handy.

First crafting steps were:
- cutting the wood with a table saw
- drilling holes for connection
- grinding
- painting
- repeat grinding and painting

A brief intermediate project came up when my grandfathers grinding machine broke down. But after installing new bearings it worked as good as new till this day.

We then carried the finished parts to the front of the house and fixed them together with threaded rots. Barrels were strapped on for the transport down to the next canal.

Bringing the structure down to the canal and letting it to water for the first time felt great.

On the water, we continued by installing flooring, a frame structure and seats.

We bought batteries and an electric engine, registered the raft with the municipality and had many memorable days and evenings.
