A brief look into the kind of things I crafted or worked on in the past.

## Raft

During Covid in Amsterdam, the usual spring conversations about having a boat for summer were coming up in 2021. Together with a friend I decided to take a practical approach and just see what we can DIY.

Let me walk you through some parts of the process. After fiddling around with some sketches, we came up with a base construction in wood that would hold empty rain barrels - for floating - in place. Having a ground floor apartment with a little green space in the back came in handy.

First crafting steps were:
- cutting the wood with a table saw
- drilling holes for connection
- grinding
- painting
- repeat grinding and painting

A brief intermediate project came up when my grandfathers grinding machine broke down. But after installing new bearings it works as good as new to this day.

We then carried the finished parts to the front of the house and fixed them together with threaded rots. Barrels were strapped on for the transport down to the next canal.

Bringing the structure down to the canal and letting it to water for the first time felt great.

On the water, we continued by installing flooring, a frame structure and seats.

We bought batteries and an electric engine, registered the raft with the municipality and had many memorable days and evenings.

## Door

When moving to Paris my apartment came with two doors missing, so I got to work for having the option to seperate the living room from the hall way.

Putting up a blanket to keep some heat in the room was always going to be an intermediate solution.

After some research on leboncoin I found a door with the right width to fit the frame for a reasonable price. The hight however was an issue since the characteristic pattern would be interupted by simply cutting it to shape. Starting by removing a symmetrical part on the bottom, I had to take piece out of the upper side pattern.

I used dowels to connect both parts again in the right place.

After filling the remaining gaps and a paint job the result is not too bad for the work of a mechanical engineer with no wood working training.

## Bikes

An old 70s race bike from dutch brand "Batavus" got me into fixing up old bikes. I've since then become the supplier for my friends and family and have also started to work with cyclofficine in Paris, an association that offers bike workshops in the north of the city.

My green Batavus racer in all original state from 1971 with a Shimano 600 Arabesque drive train.

The first bike I had in Paris, now with a friend but I still take good care of it.

First complete makeover I did. A peugeot bike for a friends 30s birthday earlier this year.
